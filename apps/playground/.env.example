# Surf API base URL for live backend integration.
# When set, the playground bypasses MSW and hits the real surf API.
# When unset (default), all requests are handled by the MSW mock.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to .env.local
#   2. Set VITE_SURF_API_URL to your running surf API base path
#   3. Run `pnpm dev` — the badge in the header shows the live URL
#
# The surf API must be running and have CORS configured to allow http://localhost:3000.
# The default surf dev config already includes this origin.
#
VITE_SURF_API_URL=http://localhost:8090/api/v1
