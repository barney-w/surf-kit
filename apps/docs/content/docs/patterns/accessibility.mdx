# Accessibility

AI agent interfaces must meet **WCAG 2.2 Level AA** accessibility standards. These interfaces introduce unique challenges around streaming content, dynamic responses, and confidence indicators. This guide provides a comprehensive checklist and practical guidance.

## WCAG 2.2 AA checklist for agent interfaces

### Perceivable

| Criterion | Requirement | surf-kit support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1.1 Non-text content | All images and icons have text alternatives | Agent avatars include `alt` text; icons use `aria-hidden` with adjacent labels |
| 1.3.1 Info and relationships | Structure is conveyed programmatically | Message list uses semantic roles; headings are properly nested |
| 1.3.5 Identify input purpose | Input fields have autocomplete attributes | TextInput and Select support HTML `autocomplete` |
| 1.4.1 Use of colour | Colour is not the sole means of conveying information | Badges include text labels; confidence shows text alongside colour |
| 1.4.3 Contrast (minimum) | Text has 4.5:1 contrast ratio | All tokens tested for contrast compliance |
| 1.4.4 Resize text | Text can be resized to 200% without loss | Layout uses relative units; text scales with browser zoom |
| 1.4.10 Reflow | Content reflows at 320px width | All layouts are responsive; chat adapts to narrow viewports |
| 1.4.11 Non-text contrast | UI components have 3:1 contrast | Borders, focus rings, and icons meet this threshold |
| 1.4.13 Content on hover/focus | Tooltips are dismissible and persistent | Tooltip component follows React Aria patterns |

### Operable

| Criterion | Requirement | surf-kit support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.1.1 Keyboard | All functionality is keyboard accessible | All components built on React Aria with keyboard support |
| 2.1.2 No keyboard trap | Focus can always move away | Dialog and Sheet include Escape to close; no traps elsewhere |
| 2.4.3 Focus order | Focus order is logical | Tab order follows visual layout |
| 2.4.6 Headings and labels | Headings and labels are descriptive | All inputs have visible labels; dialogs have headings |
| 2.4.7 Focus visible | Focus indicator is visible | Global `focus-visible` ring style applied |
| 2.4.11 Focus not obscured | Focused element is not hidden | Sticky headers and footers do not cover focused elements |
| 2.5.8 Target size | Interactive targets are at least 24x24px | Buttons and controls meet minimum size requirement |

### Understandable

| Criterion | Requirement | surf-kit support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3.1.1 Language of page | `lang` attribute on HTML element | ThemeProvider includes `lang` configuration |
| 3.2.1 On focus | No context change on focus | Components do not trigger navigation on focus |
| 3.3.1 Error identification | Errors are described in text | TextInput, Select show text error messages |
| 3.3.2 Labels or instructions | Inputs have labels | All form components require label props |
| 3.3.3 Error suggestion | Suggestions for fixing errors | Error messages include corrective guidance |

### Robust

| Criterion | Requirement | surf-kit support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4.1.2 Name, role, value | All components have accessible names and roles | React Aria handles ARIA attributes |
| 4.1.3 Status messages | Status changes are announced | `aria-live` regions on chat messages, alerts, and streaming indicators |

## AI-specific considerations

### Streaming content

- Use `aria-live="polite"` on the message container so screen readers announce new content without interrupting.
- Avoid rapid-fire announcements during token streaming — batch content updates.
- Announce phase transitions (thinking, writing, complete) as status updates.

### Confidence indicators

- Never use colour alone to indicate confidence levels.
- Always include a text label (High, Medium, Low).
- Consider whether showing confidence scores helps or confuses your audience.

### Source citations

- All source links must be real `<a>` elements, not styled `<span>` or `<div>` elements.
- External links should open in new tabs with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- Include descriptive link text (not "click here" or bare URLs).

### Agent handoffs

- Announce handoff transitions clearly: "You are now speaking with [Agent Name]".
- Do not change the interface dramatically during a handoff — maintain visual continuity.
- Provide a way to return to the previous agent or cancel the handoff.

### Chat input

- The input field must have an associated label (even if visually hidden).
- `Enter` to send and `Shift+Enter` for new line must be documented and consistent.
- Provide character count feedback for inputs with length limits.

## Testing checklist

### Automated testing

```bash
# Run axe-core on the docs site
pnpm dlx @axe-core/cli https://localhost:3000/chat

# Run lighthouse accessibility audit
pnpm dlx lighthouse https://localhost:3000/chat --only-categories=accessibility
```

### Manual testing

- [ ] Navigate the entire chat interface using only the keyboard
- [ ] Complete a full conversation using a screen reader (VoiceOver, NVDA, or JAWS)
- [ ] Zoom the browser to 200% and verify no content is lost
- [ ] Set the browser width to 320px and verify the layout adapts
- [ ] Enable `prefers-reduced-motion` and verify animations are disabled
- [ ] Enable high contrast mode and verify all content is visible
- [ ] Test with voice control (e.g., Dragon NaturallySpeaking)

### Screen reader testing matrix

| Screen reader | Browser | Platform | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VoiceOver | Safari | macOS/iOS | High |
| NVDA | Firefox | Windows | High |
| JAWS | Chrome | Windows | Medium |
| TalkBack | Chrome | Android | Medium |

## Accessibility statement

Consider publishing an accessibility statement for your deployment. Include:

- Conformance level (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- Known issues and workarounds
- How to report accessibility problems
- Contact details for accessibility support

```tsx
// Example: Accessibility statement page
export default function AccessibilityStatement() {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>Accessibility statement</h1>
      <p>
        This service aims to meet WCAG 2.2 Level AA. We want as many people
        as possible to be able to use this website, including the AI assistant
        feature.
      </p>
      <h2>Conformance status</h2>
      <p>
        This website is partially conformant with WCAG 2.2 Level AA.
      </p>
      {/* ... */}
    </article>
  );
}
```
