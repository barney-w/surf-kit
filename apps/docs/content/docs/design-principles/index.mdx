# Design Principles

surf-kit is built on five core principles. Every component, token, and API decision is evaluated against these tenets.

## 1. AI-first, not AI-added

surf-kit is purpose-built for agent interfaces, not a general-purpose UI library with AI features bolted on as an afterthought. Every component is designed with AI interaction patterns in mind: streaming responses, tool calls, multi-turn conversations, and autonomous agent workflows.

This means components like `AgentChat`, source citations, and confidence indicators are first-class citizens, not add-ons.

## 2. Trust through transparency

Users must trust AI-generated output. surf-kit makes this possible by ensuring every response can show its sources, confidence level, and verification status. Components expose attribution metadata, reasoning traces, and actionable feedback mechanisms.

Design decisions favour explicitness over brevity. When in doubt, surface more information rather than less.

## 3. Accessible by default

Every component meets **WCAG 2.2 AA** standards out of the box. This includes:

- Full keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility via ARIA attributes (powered by React Aria)
- Reduced motion support with `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Sufficient colour contrast ratios across all themes
- Focus management for modals, dialogs, and overlays

Accessibility is not optional. It is tested in CI with automated axe checks and manual screen reader verification.

## 4. Enterprise-grade theming

surf-kit uses a **token-based theming system** with three tiers:

- **Primitive tokens** — Raw values (hex colours, pixel sizes)
- **Semantic tokens** — Contextual meanings (background, text-primary, accent)
- **Component tokens** — Component-specific overrides (button-bg, input-border)

This architecture supports multi-theme deployments, dark/light mode, and white-labelling for enterprise customers. Themes are applied via CSS custom properties and can be swapped at runtime.

See the [Tokens](/docs/tokens) page for the full architecture.

## 5. Composable architecture

surf-kit supports two usage patterns:

- **Full-page layouts** — Drop in `AgentChat` or `AgentDashboard` for a complete experience with sensible defaults.
- **Individual components** — Import only what you need (`Button`, `Card`, `TextInput`) and compose your own layouts.

Components are designed as small, focused units with clear props and no hidden coupling. Higher-level compositions are built from the same primitives that you can use directly.
