/>
```

### Human escalation

```tsx

## Accessibility

- The handoff container has `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"` so transitions are announced.
- Status changes trigger screen reader announcements (e.g., "Transfer to Planning Specialist in progress").
- The reason text is always visible and announced — the handoff is never communicated through animation alone.
- Cancel and retry buttons are keyboard accessible with clear labels.
- Human escalation estimated wait times are announced.
- The transition animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Colour contrast meets **WCAG 2.2 AA** standards.
