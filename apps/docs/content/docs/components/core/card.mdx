- When interactive, the card supports `onPress` via React Aria `useButton`.
- `CardHeader` content can be linked to the card via `aria-labelledby` for interactive cards.
- Focus ring is visible on interactive cards when navigating with the keyboard.
- Colour contrast meets **WCAG 2.2 AA** standards across all variants and themes.
