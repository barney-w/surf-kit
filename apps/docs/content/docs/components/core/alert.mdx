## Accessibility

- Renders with `role="alert"` for error and warning intents, causing screen readers to announce the content immediately.
- Info and success alerts use `role="status"` for polite announcements.
- The dismiss button includes `aria-label="Dismiss alert"`.
- Colour is supported by an icon and text; colour is never the sole indicator.
- Focus is managed when alerts are dismissed — focus returns to the triggering element.
- Colour contrast meets **WCAG 2.2 AA** standards across all intents and themes.
