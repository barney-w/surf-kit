</Accordion>
```

Multiple sections can be open simultaneously.

  <AccordionItem id="b" title="Second">Content B</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

## Accessibility

- Built on **React Aria** disclosure pattern for WAI-ARIA compliance.
- Each header is a focusable button with `aria-expanded` indicating the current state.
- `aria-controls` links the header to its content panel.
- Content panels have `role="region"` and `aria-labelledby` pointing to the header.
- `Enter` and `Space` toggle the section.
- Arrow keys navigate between headers; `Home` and `End` move to the first and last header.
- Disabled items are announced as disabled and cannot be toggled.
- The expand/collapse animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Colour contrast meets **WCAG 2.2 AA** standards.
