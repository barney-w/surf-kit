# Spinner

An animated circular spinner that communicates loading or processing state. Use it inline, inside buttons, or as a full-page overlay.

## Import

```tsx
import { Spinner } from '@surf-kit/core';
```

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `size` | `'sm' \| 'md' \| 'lg'` | `'md'` | Diameter of the spinner. |
| `label` | `string` | `'Loading'` | Accessible label announced to screen readers. |
| `className` | `string` | — | Additional CSS classes. |

## Usage

### Basic

```tsx
<Spinner />
```

### With sizes

```tsx
<Spinner size="sm" />
<Spinner size="md" />
<Spinner size="lg" />
```

### With custom label

```tsx
<Spinner label="Fetching results…" />
```

### Inside a button

```tsx
<Button isDisabled>
  <Spinner size="sm" label="Saving" /> Saving…
</Button>
```

## Variants showcase

### Small

16px spinner, ideal for inline indicators and buttons.

```tsx
<Spinner size="sm" />
```

### Medium (default)

24px spinner, suitable for content areas.

```tsx
<Spinner size="md" />
```

### Large

40px spinner, used for page-level or section-level loading states.

```tsx
<Spinner size="lg" />
```

## Accessibility

- Renders with `role="status"` so screen readers announce the loading state.
- The `label` prop is applied as `aria-label` for screen reader users.
- Uses CSS animation rather than JavaScript for smooth performance.
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — animation is paused and a static indicator is shown.
- Colour contrast meets **WCAG 2.2 AA** standards.
